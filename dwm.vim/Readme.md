### dwm.vim : Tiled Window Management for Vim

dwm.vim adds tiled window management capabilities to Vim. It is highly inspired by [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) (Dynamic Window Manager) tiled layout management.

Windows are always organised as follows: 

```
===================================
|              |        S1        | 
|              |===================
|      M       |        S2        | 
|              |===================
|              |        S3        | 
===================================
```

Use the following commands to create, browse and close windows: 

- `CTRL-N` Creates a new window and place it in the area [M] & stacks all previous windows in the [S] areas. 
- `CTRL-C` Close the current window if no unsaved changes 
- `CTRL-J` Jumps to next window (clockwise) 
- `CTRL-K` Jumps to previous window (anti-clockwise) 
- `CTRL-F` Focus the current window, that is, place it in the [M] area & stacks all other windows in the [S] areas

### Remarks

There is only one tiled layout available right now, but do not hesitate to *fork it*!
